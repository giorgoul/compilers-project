# MiniJava Static Analysis Tool (Type Checker)

A semantic analysis module for a subset of the Java language (MiniJava), implemented in **Java**. This tool performs static analysis on source code to ensure type safety before compilation.

## Key Features
* **Visitor Design Pattern:** Implements the Visitor pattern to efficiently traverse the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
* **Semantic Analysis:** Validates type consistency, method definitions, and variable declarations.
* **OOP Handling:** Correctly handles complex Object-Oriented concepts including inheritance, polymorphism, and scope resolution.
* **Error Reporting:** Provides detailed feedback on compilation errors and type mismatches.

## Technologies Used
* Java
* JavaCC
